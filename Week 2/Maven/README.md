Exercise 1: Configuring a Basic Spring Application
Scenario: 
Your company is developing a web application for managing a library. You need to use the Spring Framework to handle the backend operations.
Steps:
1.	Set Up a Spring Project:
o	Create a Maven project named LibraryManagement.
o	Add Spring Core dependencies in the pom.xml file.
2.	Configure the Application Context:
o	Create an XML configuration file named applicationContext.xml in the src/main/resources directory.
o	Define beans for BookService and BookRepository in the XML file.
3.	Define Service and Repository Classes:
o	Create a package com.library.service and add a class BookService.
o	Create a package com.library.repository and add a class BookRepository.
4.	Run the Application:
o	Create a main class to load the Spring context and test the configuration.
Exercise 2: Implementing Dependency Injection
Scenario: 
In the library management application, you need to manage the dependencies between the BookService and BookRepository classes using Spring's IoC and DI.
Steps:
1.	Modify the XML Configuration:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to wire BookRepository into BookService.
2.	Update the BookService Class:
o	Ensure that BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository.
3.	Test the Configuration:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the dependency injection.



Exercise 3: Implementing Logging with Spring AOP
Scenario: 
The library management application requires logging capabilities to track method execution times.
Steps:
1.	Add Spring AOP Dependency:
o	Update pom.xml to include Spring AOP dependency.
2.	Create an Aspect for Logging:
o	Create a package com.library.aspect and add a class LoggingAspect with a method to log execution times.
3.	Enable AspectJ Support:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to enable AspectJ support and register the aspect.
4.	Test the Aspect:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class and observe the console for log messages indicating method execution times.
Exercise 4: Creating and Configuring a Maven Project
Scenario: 
You need to set up a new Maven project for the library management application and add Spring dependencies.
Steps:
1.	Create a New Maven Project:
o	Create a new Maven project named LibraryManagement.
2.	Add Spring Dependencies in pom.xml:
o	Include dependencies for Spring Context, Spring AOP, and Spring WebMVC.
3.	Configure Maven Plugins:
o	Configure the Maven Compiler Plugin for Java version 1.8 in the pom.xml file.




Exercise 5: Configuring the Spring IoC Container
Scenario: 
The library management application requires a central configuration for beans and dependencies.
Steps:
1.	Create Spring Configuration File:
o	Create an XML configuration file named applicationContext.xml in the src/main/resources directory.
o	Define beans for BookService and BookRepository in the XML file.
2.	Update the BookService Class:
o	Ensure that the BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository.
3.	Run the Application:
o	Create a main class to load the Spring context and test the configuration.
 
Exercise 6: Configuring Beans with Annotations
Scenario: 
You need to simplify the configuration of beans in the library management application using annotations.
Steps:
1.	Enable Component Scanning:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to include component scanning for the com.library package.
2.	Annotate Classes:
o	Use @Service annotation for the BookService class.
o	Use @Repository annotation for the BookRepository class.
3.	Test the Configuration:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the annotation-based configuration.



Exercise 7: Implementing Constructor and Setter Injection
Scenario: 
The library management application requires both constructor and setter injection for better control over bean initialization.
Steps:
1.	Configure Constructor Injection:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to configure constructor injection for BookService.
2.	Configure Setter Injection:
o	Ensure that the BookService class has a setter method for BookRepository and configure it in applicationContext.xml.
3.	Test the Injection:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify both constructor and setter injection.
Exercise 8: Implementing Basic AOP with Spring
Scenario: 
The library management application requires basic AOP functionality to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging and transaction management.
Steps:
1.	Define an Aspect:
o	Create a package com.library.aspect and add a class LoggingAspect.
2.	Create Advice Methods:
o	Define advice methods in LoggingAspect for logging before and after method execution.
3.	Configure the Aspect:
o	Update applicationContext.xml to register the aspect and enable AspectJ auto-proxying.
4.	Test the Aspect:
o	Run the LibraryManagementApplication main class to verify the AOP functionality.




Exercise 9: Creating a Spring Boot Application
Scenario: 
You need to create a Spring Boot application for the library management system to simplify configuration and deployment.
Steps:
1.	Create a Spring Boot Project:
o	Use Spring Initializr to create a new Spring Boot project named LibraryManagement.
2.	Add Dependencies:
o	Include dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and H2 Database.
3.	Create Application Properties:
o	Configure database connection properties in application.properties.
4.	Define Entities and Repositories:
o	Create Book entity and BookRepository interface.
5.	Create a REST Controller:
o	Create a BookController class to handle CRUD operations.
6.	Run the Application:
o	Run the Spring Boot application and test the REST endpoints.
